# Birthday-Tracker
This was an idea I had to track my family/friends birthday's because I always forget.

# Program
This program had a simple user interface that takes user input(first name, last name, and birthday) and saves the information to a database that will manage all of the information.

# How to run
* Run the requirements.txt file to get Pyside6 or pip install it, the choice is yours.
* Run main.py

# Extra remarks
* I will be adding to the functionality of the program as the ideas come to me.
